## 🏃 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10 or higher
- Unix-like OS (Linux, macOS) or Windows

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
cd /path/to/db_engine

# Create virtual environment (optional but recommended)
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate

# Install development dependencies (for testing)
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

### Running the Server

```bash
python serve.py
```

The API server will start on **http://localhost:8080**

**Configuration**: Set the `LOG_LEVEL` environment variable to control logging:
```bash
LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG python serve.py  # Verbose logging
LOG_LEVEL=INFO python serve.py   # Default
LOG_LEVEL=WARNING python serve.py # Minimal logging
```

---

## 📡 API Endpoints

### Base URL
```
http://localhost:8080
```

### 1. Put (Write a Key-Value Pair)

**Endpoint**: `PUT /keys`

**Request Body**:
```json
{
  "key": "user:123",
  "value": "John Doe"
}
```

**Response**:
```json
{
  "success": true
}
```

**Example**:
```bash
curl -X PUT http://localhost:8080/keys \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"key": "user:123", "value": "John Doe"}'
```

---

### 2. Get (Read a Key)

**Endpoint**: `GET /keys`

**Query Parameters**:
- `key` (required): The key to retrieve

**Response**:
```json
{
  "key": "user:123",
  "value": "John Doe"
}
```

**Example**:
```bash
curl "http://localhost:8080/keys?key=user:123"
```

**Note**: Returns `null` for value if key doesn't exist (200 status).

---

### 3. Get Range (Range Query)

**Endpoint**: `GET /keys/range`

**Query Parameters**:
- `start_key` (required): Start of the key range (inclusive)
- `end_key` (required): End of the key range (exclusive)

**Response**:
```json
{
  "results": [
    {"key": "user:100", "value": "Alice"},
    {"key": "user:101", "value": "Bob"},
    {"key": "user:102", "value": "Charlie"}
  ]
}
```

**Example**:
```bash
curl "http://localhost:8080/keys/range?start_key=user:100&end_key=user:200"
```

**Note**: Range queries use k-way merge for efficient retrieval across multiple SSTables.

---

### 4. Batch Put (Write Multiple Keys)

**Endpoint**: `POST /keys/batch`

**Request Body**:
```json
{
  "keys": ["user:1", "user:2", "user:3"],
  "values": ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"]
}
```

**Response**:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "count": 3

curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/keys/batch \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"keys": ["user:1", "user:2"], "values": ["Alice", "Bob"]}'
```

**Note**: All writes are atomic - single fsync for the entire batch (100x faster than individual puts).

---

### 5. Delete (Remove a Key)

**Endpoint**: `DELETE /keys`

**Query Parameters**:
- `key` (required): The key to delete

**Response**:
```json
{
  "success": true
}
```

**Example**:
```bash
curl -X DELETE "http://localhost:8080/keys?key=user:123"
```

**Note**: Deletes are implemented using tombstones and don't immediately free disk space.

## 🔧 Configuration

### Engine Configuration

The engine can be configured when initializing:

```python
from src.engine import Engine

# Create engine with custom memtable threshold
engine = await Engine.create(
    storage_dir="./data",
    memtable_threshold=4 * 1024 * 1024  # 4MB (default: 2MB)
)
```

**Parameters**:
- `storage_dir`: Directory for storing WAL and SSTable files
- `memtable_threshold`: Size in bytes before flushing memtable to disk (default: 2MB)

**Validation**:
- `memtable_threshold` must be between 1 byte and 1GB
- `storage_dir` must be writable
- Invalid configuration fails fast at initialization

## 🏗️ Architecture Deep Dive

### Write Path

1. **Client** → HTTP PUT request → `serve.py`
2. **Engine.put()** → Acquires write lock (single-writer)
3. **WAL.append()** → Append entry with CRC32 checksum → **fsync** to disk
4. **MemTable.put()** → Insert into Red-Black Tree (O(log N))
5. **Size Check** → If memtable > threshold, schedule flush
6. **Background Worker** → Converts MemTable → SSTable on disk

### Read Path

1. **Client** → HTTP GET request → `serve.py`
2. **Engine.get()** → Check active memtable (O(log N))
3. If not found → Check immutable memtables (newest first)
4. If not found → Check SSTables (newest first, O(1) index lookup per SSTable)
5. Return value or `None`

### Range Query Path

1. **Client** → HTTP GET /keys/range → `serve.py`
2. **Engine.get_range()** → Collect iterators from all sources
3. **K-Way Merge** → Use min-heap to merge sorted results (O(M log K))
4. **Deduplication** → Keep newest version of each key
5. Return sorted list of (key, value) tuples

### Crash Recovery

1. **Engine.create()** → Check for WAL files in storage directory
2. **Recovery** → For each WAL, replay entries into MemTable
3. **Validation** → CRC32 checksum verification (fail-fast on corruption)
4. **Flush** → Convert recovered MemTables to SSTables
5. **Clean Up** → Delete recovered WAL files
6. Engine ready for use

## 📝 TODOs / Future Enhancements

### High Priority

- **SSTable Compaction**: Implement background compaction to merge SSTables and reduce read amplification. Currently, read performance degrades with SSTable count (~250 SSTables after 1000 flushes).

- **Adding Replication**: Implement replication for high availability and disaster recovery.

- **Automatic Failover**: Add support for automatic failover in case of node failures.

### Medium Priority

- Bloom filters for SSTable key existence checks (useful when memory constrained)
- Block cache for frequently accessed SSTable blocks
- Compression support (Snappy, LZ4, Zstd)
- Snapshots for backup and restore

### Low Priority

- Metrics and monitoring (Prometheus integration)
- Admin API for operations (stats, compaction triggers)
- Range tombstones for efficient range deletions
- Secondary indexes

---

## 🐛 Known Limitations

1. **No Compaction**: SSTables accumulate over time. Read performance degrades after ~1000 flushes. Compaction implementation is the top priority.

2. **Single-Writer**: Write operations are serialized (by design for consistency). For higher write throughput, consider running multiple instances with partitioning.

3. **No Authentication**: The HTTP API has no authentication. Not suitable for production use without additional security measures.

4. **Fixed Key-Value Types**: Keys and values must be strings. Binary data requires Base64 encoding.

5. **Tombstone Storage**: Deleted keys occupy space until compaction (not yet implemented).
